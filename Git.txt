Hey Connections What ever the things should be as the Begineer in Git
Before Deep dive into Git make sure that raise these questions in your mind 
1.What is Git?
2.When we use Git?
3.How we use?
Let we come to By answering one by one 
1 ans.Git is an Version Control System
2 ans.Before Knowing this answer we come to know that Git is an version control System 
So from name itself we can come to know that which is having enough capable to controlling
the Version .
3 ans.To Know this answer we make our hands Dirty by doing some commands .
Note:Frist thing we should set the credentials in proper Manner
->for example as Begineer your supposed to set the credentials ,just by using
this command we can able to :
 git config --global user.name "name" 
 git config --global user.email email
 ->After excuting of this two commands we are succesfully changed the credentials
 ->To check  this we make use of this command:
 git config --list
 ->And let we start to implement the git
 ->Frist command:git init
 ->Usage of the git init command to initialize
 ->Checking the status of the file by using this file
 ->  git status
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ->Let we deep dive into it Git consists of the four parts
 1.Working Directory
 2.Staging Area
 3.Local Repositry
 4.Remote Repositry
 Same three Questions Should be raise in our mind  
 ->ie What , When ,How 
 ->So Knowing about the Working Directory ,it means where we write our code or content
 ->And what is the use of the Staging Area ,Before knowing about Staging Area we should 
 know about in which format files were sent in to the Local Repositry,it means it can 
 able to take the blocks of files at a time not one by one ,So to overcome this 
 Staging Area comes into Picture where we can able send in one by one format from 
 working Directory to Staging Area.
 ->By using this command we  can able to  add files in to Working Directory to Staging Area
 git add file-name
 to add multiple files into it we can make use this command
 git add.
 ->And by using this we can able to move the files from Staging Area to Local Repositry
 git commit -m "comment"
 ->And creating the repo in Git hub and pushing the code into that repo
ig git  remote origin ---link---
and then git push --u origin branch name {master}
->by using this command we can able to create new branch
ie check out -b Branch name
